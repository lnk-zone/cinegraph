```

### State Management Strategy
- **Global State**: User authentication, app settings, theme
- **Server State**: Stories, graph data, user data (React Query)
- **Component State**: UI state, form inputs, temporary data
- **URL State**: Filters, pagination, active views

### API Integration
- **GraphQL**: Primary API communication
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates and collaboration
- **REST**: File uploads and downloads
- **Cache Strategy**: Optimistic updates with fallback
