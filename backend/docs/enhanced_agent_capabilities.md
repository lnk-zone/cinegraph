```python
character_analysis = await agent.analyze_character_consistency(story_id, character_name, user_id)
```

**Provides:**
- Character relationship mapping
- Knowledge evolution tracking
- Contradiction detection
- Consistency scoring (0-1 scale)

#### **Plot Hole Detection**
```python
plot_holes = await agent.detect_plot_holes(story_id, user_id)
```

**Detects:**
- Impossible knowledge scenarios
- Location contradictions
- Temporal paradoxes

## üîß Usage Examples

### **Basic Query Validation**
```python
# Validate a query before execution
validation_result = await agent.validate_query(
    "MATCH (c:Character {story_id: $story_id}) RETURN c.name"
)

if validation_result["valid"]:
    # Execute the query
    result = await agent.graph_query(query, params)
```

### **Using Query Templates**
```python
# Use optimized template for character relationships
result = await agent.optimized_query(
    "character_relationships",
    {
        "story_id": "story_123",
        "character_name": "John",
        "user_id": "user_456"
    }
)
```

### **Advanced Story Analysis**
```python
# Comprehensive timeline analysis
timeline = await agent.analyze_story_timeline("story_123", "user_456")

# Character consistency check
character_analysis = await agent.analyze_character_consistency(
    "story_123", "John", "user_456"
)

# Plot hole detection
plot_holes = await agent.detect_plot_holes("story_123", "user_456")
```

### **AI-Generated Custom Queries**
```python
# AI can generate queries based on natural language
question = "What did John know at the beginning of chapter 3?"
result = await agent.query_story("story_123", question, "user_456")
```
