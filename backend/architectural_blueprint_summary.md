# Architectural Blueprint & Ownership Matrix - Executive Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural blueprint and ownership matrix for the CineGraphAgent system, clearly defining the separation of concerns across three primary components: Graphiti (Neo4j), CineGraphAgent (OpenAI Agent SDK), and FastAPI service layer.

## Core Components & Primary Responsibilities

### 1. Graphiti (Neo4j) - Data Foundation Layer
**Core Mission**: Storage primitives and temporal reasoning

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Graph storage and retrieval operations
- Temporal reasoning and time-based queries
- Entity extraction and relationship mapping
- Contradiction detection algorithms
- Data consistency and integrity maintenance

**Key Interfaces**:
- Cypher-like query interface
- Entity extraction API
- Temporal reasoning engine
- Contradiction detection service

### 2. CineGraphAgent (OpenAI Agent SDK) - Intelligence Layer
**Core Mission**: Natural language interface and cognitive reasoning

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Natural language processing and understanding
- Intent recognition and classification
- Higher-level reasoning operations
- Alert ranking and prioritization
- Context management and state maintenance

**Key Interfaces**:
- Natural language query processing
- Reasoning engine API
- Alert ranking service
- Context state management

### 3. FastAPI Service Layer - Orchestration Layer
**Core Mission**: System coordination and external interface

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Request orchestration and routing
- Authentication and authorization (Supabase integration)
- WebSocket management and event streaming
- Input/output validation enforcement
- Logging, monitoring, and error handling

**Key Interfaces**:
- REST API endpoints
- WebSocket connections
- Authentication middleware
- Event streaming system

## RACI Matrix Summary

| Component | Primary Role | Secondary Role | Key Collaborations |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Graphiti** | Data operations (R) | Provide data context (C) | CineGraphAgent queries, FastAPI orchestration |
| **CineGraphAgent** | AI reasoning (R) | Data interpretation (C) | Graphiti data access, FastAPI coordination |
| **FastAPI** | System orchestration (R) | Service coordination (A) | All component integration |

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each component has a clearly defined primary function:
- Graphiti: Data and temporal operations
- CineGraphAgent: Intelligence and reasoning
- FastAPI: Orchestration and external interface

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- **Data Layer**: Graphiti handles all storage and retrieval
- **Intelligence Layer**: CineGraphAgent manages AI/ML operations
- **Service Layer**: FastAPI coordinates system-wide operations

### 3. Interface Contracts
Well-defined APIs between components ensure:
- Loose coupling
- Independent development
- Clear communication protocols
- Testability and maintainability

## Decision Making Authority

### Component-Level Decisions
- **Graphiti**: Data architecture team accountable
- **CineGraphAgent**: AI/ML team accountable
- **FastAPI**: Backend team accountable

### Cross-Component Decisions
- **System Architecture**: Joint responsibility with FastAPI as coordinator
- **Security**: Security team accountable, all teams responsible
- **Performance**: Shared responsibility with monitoring through FastAPI

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. Scalability
- Independent scaling of each component
- Clear bottleneck identification
- Modular performance optimization

### 2. Maintainability
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Isolated changes and updates
- Reduced cognitive load per team

### 3. Development Velocity
- Parallel development streams
- Clear integration points
- Reduced merge conflicts

### 4. Testability
- Component-level testing
- Clear mocking boundaries
- Integration test clarity

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Communication Overhead
- **Mitigation**: Well-defined interface contracts
- **Monitoring**: Regular architecture reviews

### 2. Integration Complexity
- **Mitigation**: FastAPI orchestration layer
- **Monitoring**: Integration testing suite

### 3. Performance Bottlenecks
- **Mitigation**: Independent scaling capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Component-level performance metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Technical Specifications**: Define detailed API contracts for each interface
2. **Implementation Planning**: Create development roadmap per component
3. **Testing Strategy**: Establish component and integration testing approaches
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement observability across all layers
5. **Documentation**: Create detailed technical documentation for each component
